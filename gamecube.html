                <ul class="gc-funFacts-list">
                    <li><h1>It's Not Actually A "Cube"</h1><p>
                        Despite its seemingly clear-cut moniker, the GameCube is really a "Cube" in name only. Though its width and length do manage to get close at 5.9 inches and 6.3 inches respectively, its height is over an inch smaller at 4.3. Technically speaking, this would make it really more akin to a "Game rectangle," though this name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue...
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>Comes With Two Alternate Startup Sounds</h1><p>
                        A single image of the GameCube's logo is likely all it takes for fans to recall that trademark technical sound bite. But as it happens, Nintendo tossed in a subtle easter egg that prompts not one, but two alternate startup sounds. The first - a hodgepodge of whimsical, cartoony noises and a child's laugh - can be triggered by holding the "Z" button at the startup screen. The second produces a "ninja-like" soundbite, which plays when the "Z" button on four controllers is simultaneously held down. This one requires either a few friends to help out or a knack for multitasking, but it's a neat little tune worth hearing.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>It Dabbled In Online Gaming</h1><p>
                        Game consoles of the current era offer a ton of online-heavy games and are firmly tethered into the internet realm. And while the GameCube is widely seen as one of the final bastions of local multiplayer, the Big N did at least dip their toes in this evolutionary step which was still in its infancy.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>A Mirrored Version Of Zelda</h1><p>
                        Before Breath of the Wild, Twilight Princess was seen by many as the pinnacle of the epic 3D Zelda romp. It can be considered the swan song for the Cube and a "link" to the Wii - pun not intended - as it was also released as a Wii launch title. Though the games are largely the same, one key difference comes in the form of Link's right vs lefthandedness. In typical fashion, the hero wields his sword in his left hand on the GameCube version. However, Nintendo decided to mirror the Wii version so that players wielding a Wiimote would match better with Link's right-handed sword swipes.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>Pikmin Is (Technically) Playable On PC</h1><p>
                        As it happens, Nintendo left an ".exe" file in their tactical IP for GameCube, Pikmin. Nowadays, of course, the Dolphin Emulator allows for this feat whilst bypassing the physical media completely. Yet, there actually was a way to play directly from the actual disk on a Windows machine - at least after a few required "workaround tasks."
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>A "Wave" Of Change For Controllers</h1><p>
                        People tend to remember the Cube controller for being the still-superior method of playing Super Smash Bros. Yet, it's also the controller that truly solidified and popularized the use of wireless controllers. Though there had been efforts by various third parties dating back several years prior, Nintendo's WaveBird was the first wireless gamepad produced by a first-party console manufacturer. Its solid build and reliable nature made it a favorite for many players, even absent of the immersive rumble feature.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>Graphics Engine Capable Of Stereoscopic 3D</h1><p>
                        Nintendo's "Gekko" graphics card tends to be mainly remembered for its cool name. Yet it also had the distinction of being able to display stereoscopic 3D. This was scarcely utilized, however, as 3D TVs were still very much in their infancy. Ironically, it's one of the launch games, Luigi's Mansion, which served as a rare title that supported this novel feature. A specialized LCD screen that could attach to the console was also capable of displaying these 3D visuals.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>The Story Behind The Unique "A" Button</h1><p>
                        Many remember the GameCube's distinct controller for its odd button layout, which largely revolves around the bold "A" button in the center. The reasons for this is primarily tied into the types of games the developers sought to make. Nintendo's famed game designer Shigeru Miyamoto had expressed a desire for this button to be the centerpiece for GameCube's software - and even serving as the only face button for some games. The point was for the "action" button to be primarily used, thus the decision to make it stand out and easy to access. An early prototype even had the "B" button taking on the curved shape that surrounded the "A" button, further emphasizing this point.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>A DVD-Supporting Variant Exists</h1><p>
                        In addition to unique features like the miniDVD format, the GameCube received some criticism for excluding the ability to play DVD movies. Sony and Microsft utilized this technology to their advantage, as the format was taking off at the time and was a valuable asset to many consumers. However, there actually was a short-lived variant of the Cube that was able to play DVD movies. Enter the "Panasonic Q," a sleek, sophisticated device that only barely saw the light of day. It was launched exclusively in Japan in 2001, before being discontinued two years later on account of weak sales.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><h1>It Was (Mostly) More Powerful Than The PS2</h1><p>
                        Sony consoles to be known for their horsepower these days. But believe it or not, Nintendo was still largely the branding that was "playing with power" back in the early 2000s. The PS2 did edge out the Cube in certain areas - namely in its ability to push more raw polygons. Yet, overall Nintendo's console reigned supreme in terms of hardware prowess. Its more resourceful, programmer-friendly build allowed for games that performed and looked at least a bit better.

             <h1 class="gc-main-content-header">Nintendo Gamecube &copy</h1>
                  <p class="tab">The Nintendo GameCube (abbreviated as GameCube, GC, GCN, or NGC) is Nintendo's fourth home console and a sixth generation video game console initially released on September 14, 2001 in Japan. Nintendo first mentioned a successor to the Nintendo 64 on March 3, 1999, a day after Sony's announcement of the PlayStation 2. Two months later, on May 12, 1999, Nintendo of America's former chairman Howard Lincoln officially announced the console, which would be codenamed Dolphin. Nintendo remained quiet for over a year about the project, preferring to focus on the Nintendo 64 and the Game Boy Color at E3 2000. It wasn't until August 24, 2000, a day before Spaceworld 2000, that the company officially unveiled the GameCube, the end result of the Dolphin project. The five colors for the console shown at Spaceworld 2000 were purple, black, silver, gold, and magenta. However, in the final build, purple, black, and silver were kept, but gold and magenta were scrapped and replaced with orange.</p>
                  <p class="tab">The heart of the GameCube is a IBM-developed CPU called the Gekko. The Gekko is based on IBM's general-purpose PowerPC 750CXe with custom features. The system's 202.5 MHz GPU, called Flipper, was designed by Art X and after ATi bought Art X, was produced by ATi. For its storage medium, the GameCube uses 8 cm discs based on the DVD, developed by Matsushita Panasonic, that can hold up to 1.5GB. Since they are smaller than traditional DVD's, the GameCube is not able to play DVD movies, though through a partnership with Nintendo, Panasonic manufactured and distributed the Panasonic Q, a hybrid DVD player console with GameCube hardware.</p>
                  <p class="tab">The GameCube's controller combines elements from just about every controller before it, as well as introducing a few innovations of its own. In addition to the standard analog stick, D-Pad, and shoulder buttons, Nintendo has added an analog C-Stick often referred to as the camera stick replacing the four yellow C-buttons from the Nintendo 64 controller, moved the Z-button to the right shoulder and rearranged the button configuration so that there is a large A button surrounded by the X, Y, and B buttons and having the middle part from the Nintendo 64 controller removed for better comfort. In Spaceworld 2000, the colors of the A, B, and start buttons are identical to the colours of the buttons from the Nintendo 64 controller (blue, green, and red), but in the final build, the A, B, and Start buttons are now changed to green, red, and gray, respectively.</p>
                  <p class="tab">The shoulder buttons L and R are both analogue, allowing the console to know how far they are pushed in, for things like throttle in racing games. Like the Nintendo 64, the GameCube features four controller ports. The regular GameCube memory card holds 4MB of data, but the Digicard Adapter will allow for flash memory cards that can hold 64MB to 128MB, effectively giving the console the functionality of the failed 64DD add-on for the N64. A choice between a 56K modem and broadband adapter was available for online connectivity, but neither of these add-ons were included with the console.</p>
                  <p class="tab">Unlike the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color, which connect using an adapter, the GameCube can interface directly with the Game Boy Advance via the Game Boy Advance to Nintendo GameCube Link Cable to transmit information back and forth. The last title released for the GameCube was Madden NFL 08 (which was also released for the Wii and DS) on August 14, 2007, though first-party development ended six months earlier. In November 2006, the GameCube was succeeded by the Wii (with models released before November 2011 being fully compatible with GameCube games and controllers). Later revisions removed support to save costs. In early 2009, the GameCube was discontinued with 22 million units sold. Hardware and software sales concluded later the same year. In Japan, the GameCube was one of the first two Nintendo systems to have its games rated by the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), whose rating system had been put to use during the system's lifetime.</p>
             <h1>History and development</h1>
                  <p class="tab">Development on the GameCube began after the launch of the Nintendo 64. Nintendo has stated multiple times that the moment a system is launched, the plans to create its successor are already in motion. Prior to the launch of the GameCube, Nintendo referred to it as the Nintendo Dolphin. Indeed, several video games released near the launch of the console bare references to this popular code name.</p>
                  <p class="tab">Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto has stated that the transition from developing on the Nintendo 64 to the GameCube was fairly easy when compared to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to Nintendo 64 transition. He compared the move to the NES to SNES changeover in that basically the GameCube wasn't as much of a revolution as it was an evolution over its predecessor.</p>
                  <p class="tab">The design of the GameCube has often been criticized. During the launch of the Wii, even Nintendo recognized that several critics thought that the GameCube was designed to look like a toy. The handle in particular caused several pundits to joke that the piece of hardware looked like a lunchbox. The controller, on the other hand, was greatly praised for being comfortable, and the Wavebird in particular was lauded for its wireless capabilities. Nintendo implemented a digital and analog mode in the controller's L and R buttons, new to the system.</p>
             <h1>Interface</h1>
                <p class="tab">The GameCube menu is unlike the Xbox or PlayStation 2 menus. The music for the GameCube menu seems unique and especially slow at first, but when sped up around 19 times, the tune is actually a slightly lower pitched version of the Famicom Disk System's BIOS.</p>
               <p class="tab">There are also several Easter egg start-up noises activated by pressing the Z button on a specific amount of controllers. If you hold the Z button on 1 controller when turning the system on, you will hear squeaky noises and a baby's laughter at the end. Holding the Z button on all 4 controllers produces a Japanese oriental style sound effect, with a man shouting a battle cry at the end.</p>
                <h1>Menu</h1>
                <p class="tab">The menu is a cube, and consists of 5 different screens. The first is the picture you see on the right, the second being where you start up the game, the third being where you adjust the screens position and sound, the fourth being where you can erase, copy or move data on your memory cards and the last one tells you the date and time. It was removed when the Nintendo Wii had backward compatibility for the Nintendo GameCube. This has been changed due to Wii having settings for the GameCube memory cards and Wii settings.</p>
             <h1>Legacy</h1>
                <p class="tab">The GameCube performed rather poorly, saleswise (Currently Being Redacted By Scott Wozniak). Following the GameCube's launch, Miyamoto admitted that it had sold far less than he and Nintendo had expected. It is Nintendo's third worst-selling performing system of all time, only doing better than the Virtual Boy and the Wii U. The PlayStation had caused Nintendo to lose its market share during the Nintendo 64 generation, and the GameCube just made matters worse. The PlayStation 2's sales numbers dwarfed those of the GameCube's, while the Xbox sold slightly more.</p>
                <p class="tab">Interestingly, however, Nintendo made more money during the GameCube generation than their competitors, thanks in part to the Game Boy Advance and the moderate sales of the GameCube and its software. Whereas Nintendo made money almost every year from the launch to the discontinuation of the system, the competition's game departments regularly lost money.</p>
                <p class="tab">The GameCube featured several titles that are noted for their quality even today. Retro Studios made their video game debut with Metroid Prime on the GameCube. Upon being announced, many speculated whether a Western developer, especially one that had just been established, could create a successor to what was generally regarded as one of the greatest games of all time, Super Metroid.</p>
                <p class="tab">Their earnest hard work and determination payed off, as Metroid Prime was not only critically acclaimed, but sold millions of units as well. Another Western Nintendo developer, Nintendo Software Technology in Washington, also made a big splash on the GameCube with Wave Race: Blue Storm and 1080° Avalanche. Canadian developer Silicon Knights created one of Nintendo's only Mature rated video games, Eternal Darkness Sanity's Requiem.</p>
                <p class="tab">While Western developers proved themselves greatly on the system, Japanese companies developed more successful software. Super Smash Bros. Melee is considered by most to be a huge improvement over the Nintendo 64 original Super Smash Bros., and is the best selling title on the system. The GameCube was also the height of the Mario Party franchise, with an astounding four video games being released for the system, more than any other console. The Pikmin franchise began on the GameCube, with Pikmin and Pikmin 2 both being huge successes for Nintendo.</p>
                <p class="tab">The GameCube was the last Nintendo console that Rare, the English developer known for Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, and GoldenEye 007, developed for. After a lackluster reception for Star Fox Adventures, Nintendo sold their shares in Rare to Microsoft for over $300 million. Microsoft has stated that they purchased Rare in order to lighten their image, despite one of Rare's first games for the company being a remake to the M rated Nintendo 64 title Conker's Bad Fur Day.</p>

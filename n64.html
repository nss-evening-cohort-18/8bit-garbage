                    <li>The Nintendo 64 was a ground-breaking console, being the first-ever console to feature 3D graphics.</li>
                    <li>The final N64 cartridge ever made was Tony Hawk Pro Skater and was released in 2002.</li>
                    <li>The Nintendo 64 went through a few name changes before its release. When developers started working on it they gave it the code-name ‘Project Reality’. It was later named the ‘Nintendo Ultra 64’, in honor of several toys made in the 1960’s such as the ‘Ultra Hand’, although this name was shortened to just the ‘Nintendo 64’ as Konami held a trademark on the name ‘Ultra Games’.</li>
                    <li>The N64 was the last major console to use cartridges. Despite this, there was a disc drive add-on called the 64DD showcased at the 1999 Space World Today game show in Japan, but this was never released outside of Japan.</li>
                    <li>As an expansion of the 64DD, the N64 also had an online service where players could download demos and compete online. It cost $25 a month but like the 64DD it never made it out of Japan.</li>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Around the end of the 1980s, Nintendo led the video game industry with its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Although the NES follow-up console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), was successful, sales took a hit from the Japanese recession. Competition from long-time rival Sega, and relative newcomer Sony, emphasized Nintendo's need to develop a successor for the SNES or risk losing market dominance to its competitors. Further complicating matters, Nintendo also faced a backlash from third-party developers unhappy with Nintendo's strict licensing policies</p>

                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p>Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), a long-time leader in graphics visualization and supercomputing, was interested in expanding its business by adapting its technology into the higher volume realm of consumer products, starting with the video game market. Based upon its MIPS R4000 family of supercomputing and workstation CPUs, SGI developed a CPU requiring a fraction of the resources—consuming only 0.5 watts of power instead of 1.5 to 2 watts, with an estimated target price of US$40 instead of US$80–200.[13] The company created a design proposal for a video game system, seeking an established partner in that market. Jim Clark, founder of SGI, offered the proposal to Tom Kalinske, who was the CEO of Sega of America. The next candidate would be Nintendo.</p>
                    <p> Kalinske said that he and Joe Miller of Sega of America were "quite impressed" with SGI's prototype, and invited their hardware team to travel from Japan to meet with SGI. The engineers from Sega Enterprises said that their evaluation of the early prototype had uncovered several hardware problems. Those were subsequently resolved, but Sega had already decided against SGI's design.[14] Nintendo disputed this account, arguing that SGI chose Nintendo because Nintendo was the more appealing partner.[12] While Sega demanded exclusive rights to the chip, Nintendo was willing to license the technology on a non-exclusive basis.[12] Michael Slater, publisher of Microprocessor Report said, "The mere fact of a business relationship there is significant because of Nintendo's phenomenal ability to drive volume. If it works at all, it could bring MIPS to levels of volume [SGI] never dreamed of.". Jim Clark met with Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi in early 1993, initiating Project Reality.[12] On August 23, 1993, the companies announced a global joint development and licensing agreement surrounding Project Reality,[15][11] projecting that the yet unnamed product would be "developed specifically for Nintendo, would be unveiled in arcades in 1994, and would be available for home use by late 1995 ... below $250".[11] This announcement coincided with Nintendo's August 1993 Shoshinkai trade show.</p>
                    <p> "Reality Immersion Technology" is the name SGI had given the set of core components, which would be first used in Project Reality: the MIPS R4300i CPU, the MIPS Reality Coprocessor, and the embedded software.[11][15][17] Some chip technology and manufacturing was provided by NEC, Toshiba, and Sharp.[18] SGI had recently acquired MIPS Computer Systems (renamed to MIPS Technologies), and the two worked together to be ultimately responsible for the design of the Reality Immersion Technology chips[11] under engineering director Jim Foran[19][20] and chief hardware architect Tim Van Hook. The initial Project Reality game development platform was developed and sold by SGI in the form of its Onyx supercomputer costing US$100,000[22]–US$250,000 (equivalent to $436,518 in 2020)[23][21] and loaded with the namesake US$50,000[24] RealityEngine2 graphics boards and four 150 MHz R4400 CPUs.[22] Its software includes early Project Reality application and emulation APIs based on Performer and OpenGL. This graphics supercomputing platform had served as the source design which SGI had reduced down to become the Reality Immersion Technology for Project Reality. The Project Reality team prototyped a game controller for the development system by modifying a Super NES controller to have a primitive analog joystick and Z trigger. Under maximal secrecy even from the rest of the company, a LucasArts developer said his team would "furtively hide the prototype controller in a cardboard box while we used it. In answer to the inevitable questions about what we were doing, we replied jokingly that it was a new type of controller—a bowl of liquid that absorbed your thoughts through your fingertips. Of course, you had to think in Japanese...".</p><p> On June 23, 1994, Nintendo announced the new official name of the still unfinished console as "Ultra 64". The first group of elite developers selected by Nintendo was nicknamed the "Dream Team": Silicon Graphics, Inc.; Alias Research, Inc.; Software Creations; Rambus, Inc.; MultiGen, Inc.; Rare, Ltd. and Rare Coin-It Toys & Games, Inc.; WMS Industries, Inc.; Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.; Williams Entertainment, Inc.; Paradigm Simulation, Inc.; Spectrum Holobyte; DMA Design Ltd.; Angel Studios;[26] Ocean; Time Warner Interactive;[27] and Mindscape. By purchasing and developing upon Project Reality's graphics supercomputing platform, Nintendo and its Dream Team could begin prototyping their games according to SGI's estimated console performance profile, prior to the finalization of the console hardware specifications. When the Ultra 64 hardware was finalized, that supercomputer-based prototyping platform was later supplanted by a much cheaper and fully accurate console simulation board to be hosted within a low-end SGI Indy workstation in July 1995.[11] SGI's early performance estimates based upon its supercomputing platform were ultimately reported to have been fairly accurate to the final Ultra 64 product, allowing LucasArts developers to port their Star Wars game prototype to console reference hardware in only three days. The console's design was publicly revealed for the first time in late Q2 1994. Images of the console displayed the Nintendo Ultra 64 logo and a ROM cartridge, but no controller. This prototype console's form factor would be retained by the product when it eventually launched. Having initially indicated the possibility of utilising the increasingly popular CD-ROM if the medium's endemic performance problems were solved,[29][30]: 77  the company now announced a much faster but space-limited cartridge-based system, which prompted open analysis by the gaming press. The system was frequently marketed as the world's first 64-bit gaming system, often stating the console was more powerful than the first moon landing computers.[31] Atari had already claimed to have made the first 64-bit game console with their Atari Jaguar,[32] but the Jaguar only uses a general 64-bit architecture in conjunction with two 32-bit RISC processors and a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000.</p><p> Later in Q2 1994, Nintendo signed a licensing agreement with Midway's parent company which enabled Midway to develop and market arcade games with the Ultra 64 brand, and formed a joint venture company called "Williams/Nintendo" to market Nintendo-exclusive home conversions of these games.[34] The result is two Ultra 64 branded arcade games, Killer Instinct and Cruis'n USA.[35] Not derived from Project Reality's console-based branch of Ultra 64, the arcade branch uses a different MIPS CPU, has no Reality Coprocessor, and uses onboard ROM chips and a hard drive instead of a cartridge.[35][36] Killer Instinct features 3D character artwork pre-rendered into 2D form, and computer-generated movie backgrounds that are streamed off the hard drive[37] and animated as the characters move horizontally. Previously, the plan had been to release the console with the name "Ultra Famicom" in Japan and "Nintendo Ultra 64" in other markets.[38][39] Rumors circulated attributing the name change to the possibility of legal action by Konami's ownership of the Ultra Games trademark. Nintendo said that trademark issues were not a factor, and the sole reason for any name change was to establish a single worldwide brand and logo for the console.[40] The new global name "Nintendo 64" was proposed by Earthbound series developer Shigesato Itoi.[41][42] The prefix for the model numbering scheme for hardware and software across the Nintendo 64 platform is "NUS-", a reference to the console's original name of "Nintendo Ultra Sixty-four".</p>

                    <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
                    <p>The console's main microprocessor is a 64-bit NEC VR4300 CPU with a clock rate of 93.75 MHz and a performance of 125 MIPS.[69] Popular Electronics said it had power similar to the Pentium processors found in desktop computers.[45] Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i,[69] though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. Nintendo 64 games generally used faster and more compact 32-bit data-operations,[citation needed] as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space (which is at a premium on the Nintendo 64's cartridges).</p>

                        <p>In terms of its random-access memory (RAM), the Nintendo 64 was one of the first consoles to implement a unified memory subsystem, instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video operations.[70] The memory itself consists of 4 megabytes of Rambus RDRAM, expandable to 8 MB with the Expansion Pak. Rambus was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth for a relatively low cost.
                        
                        Audio may be processed by the Reality Coprocessor or the CPU and is output to a DAC with up to 48.0 kHz sample rate.[71]</p>
                        
                        <p>The system allows for video output in two formats: composite video[72] and S-Video. The composite and S-Video cables are the same as those used with the preceding SNES and succeeding GameCube platforms.
                        
                        The Nintendo 64 supports 16.8 million colors.[73] The system can display resolutions from 320×240 up to 640×480 pixels. Most games that make use of the system's higher resolution mode require use of the Expansion Pak RAM upgrade; though several do not,[74] such as Acclaim's NFL Quarterback Club series and EA Sports's second generation Madden, FIFA, Supercross, and NHL games. The majority of games use the system's low resolution 320×240 mode.[74] Many games support a video display ratio of up to 16:9 using either anamorphic widescreen or letterboxing.</p>
